    """SAI keeper to bite undercollateralized cups.

    Keeper constantly looks for unsafe cups and bites them the moment they become
    unsafe. Ultimately, it should take into account the profit it can make by processing
    the resulting collateral via `bust` and only waste gas on `bite` if it can make it up
    by subsequent arbitrage. For now, it is a dumb keeper that just bites every cup
    that can be bitten.
