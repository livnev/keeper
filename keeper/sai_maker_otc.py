class SaiMakerOtc(SaiKeeper):
    """SAI keeper to act as a market maker on OasisDEX, on the W-ETH/SAI pair.

    Keeper continuously monitors and adjusts its positions in order to act as a market maker.
    It maintains buy and sell orders in multiple bands at the same time. In each buy band,
    it aims to have open SAI sell orders for at least `minSaiAmount`. In each sell band
    it aims to have open WETH sell orders for at least `minWEthAmount`. In both cases,
    it will ensure the price of open orders stays within the <minMargin,maxMargin> range
    from the current SAI/W-ETH price.

    When started, the keeper places orders for the average amounts (`avgSaiAmount`
    and `avgWEthAmount`) in each band and uses `avgMargin` to calculate the order price.

    As long as the price of orders stays within the band (i.e. is in the <minMargin,maxMargin>
    range from the current SAI/W-ETH price, which is of course constantly moving), the keeper
    keeps them open. If they leave the band, they either enter another adjacent band
    or fall outside all bands. In case of the latter, they get immediately cancelled. In case of
    the former, the keeper can keep these orders open as long as their amount is within the
    <minSaiAmount,maxSaiAmount> (for buy bands) or <minWEthAmount,maxWEthAmount> (for sell bands)
    ranges for the band they just entered. If it is above the maximum, all open orders will get
    cancelled and a new one will be created (for the `avgSaiAmount` / `avgWEthAmount`). If it is below
    the minimum, a new order gets created for the remaining amount so the total amount of orders
    in this band is equal to `avgSaiAmount` or `avgWEthAmount`.

    The same thing will happen if the total amount of open orders in a band falls below either
    `minSaiAmount` or `minWEthAmount` as a result of other market participants taking these orders.
    In this case also a new order gets created for the remaining amount so the total
    amount of orders in this band is equal to `avgSaiAmount` / `avgWEthAmount`.

    This keeper will constantly use gas to move orders as the SAI/GEM price changes. Gas usage
    can be limited by setting the margin and amount ranges wide enough and also by making
    sure that bands are always adjacent to each other and that their <min,max> amount ranges
    overlap.
