Maker Keeper API
================

The Maker Keeper API exists to provide a simple way of interacting with a set of smart contracts that create
the `SAI Stablecoin System`. It is meant to evolve towards the `DAI Stablecoin System` in the future.

They were designed to simplify and facilitate creation of external profit-seeking agents, usually called keepers,
that operate around the stablecoin set of smart contracts. The API can also be used to automate certain tasks for
other entities involved in the `Sai Stablecoin System`, like SAI issuers or traders.

**Beware!** These APIs are still in a very early stage of development and they will very likely change
and/or evolve together with the `SAI Stablecoin System`.

Most of the numeric data throughout the entire platform is kept as either `Wad` (18-digit precision type)
or `Ray` (27-digit precision type).

Contracts
---------

SAI Stablecoin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The two core smart contracts of the `SAI Stablecoin System` are ``Tub`` and ``Lpc``.

Exchanges
~~~~~~~~~

Both `OsaisDEX` and `EtherDelta` are independent of `SAI Stablecoin System`, but as a decentralized exchanges
they provide arbitrage opportunities for profit-seeking agents, so an API has been created around them as well.
